What does it do?
----------------

This is a forum and commenting system in list and tree view.
It is the oldest forum/message board extension in TYPO3. It is not aimed at competing with other
board products which feature a lot community like features with user profiles. However a front end
user login may be used to limit read/write access by simply access-restricting the very board
elements and pages used for display and submission of data. Use this extension in combination with a
front end user registration extension.
